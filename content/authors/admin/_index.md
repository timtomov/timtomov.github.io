I just started as a PhD student in the Data Analytics and Machine Learning (DAML) group at the Technical University of Munich, where I work under the supervision of Prof. Stephan Günnemann. My research focuses on uncertainty quantification in machine learning—essentially, I'm trying to figure out when models know that they don't know something. I am particularly interested in an information-theoretic view of machine learning, which provides principled foundations for understanding uncertainty and knowledge in AI systems.

Currently, I'm looking into this in the context of large language models (LLMs). Language brings a whole set of new challenges and I think there is a lot of opportunity to do groundwork and establish definitions. I am always happy to chat about these things so feel to reach out.
