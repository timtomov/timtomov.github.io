	abstract = {Background Volume of interest ({VOI}) segmentation is a crucial step for Radiomics analyses and radiotherapy ({RT}) treatment planning. Because it can be time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability, we developed and tested a Deep Learning-based automatic segmentation ({DLBAS}) algorithm to reproducibly predict the primary gross tumor as {VOI} for Radiomics analyses in extremity soft tissue sarcomas ({STS}). Methods A {DLBAS} algorithm was trained on a cohort of 157 patients and externally tested on an independent cohort of 87 patients using contrast-enhanced {MRI}. Manual tumor delineations by a radiation oncologist served as ground truths ({GTs}). A benchmark study with 20 cases from the test cohort compared the {DLBAS} predictions against manual {VOI} segmentations of two residents ({ERs}) and clinical delineations of two radiation oncologists ({ROs}). The {ROs} rated {DLBAS} predictions regarding their direct applicability. Results The {DLBAS} achieved a median dice similarity coefficient ({DSC}) of 0.88 against the {GTs} in the entire test cohort (interquartile range ({IQR}): 0.11) and a median {DSC} of 0.89 ({IQR} 0.07) and 0.82 ({IQR} 0.10) in comparison to {ERs} and {ROs}, respectively. Radiomics feature stability was high with a median intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.97, 0.95 and 0.94 for {GTs}, {ERs}, and {ROs}, respectively. {DLBAS} predictions were deemed clinically suitable by the two {ROs} in 35\% and 20\% of cases, respectively. Conclusion The results demonstrate that the {DLBAS} algorithm provides reproducible {VOI} predictions for radiomics feature extraction. Variability remains regarding direct clinical applicability of predictions for {RT} treatment planning.},
